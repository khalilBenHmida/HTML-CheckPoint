        <p><b>Resident Evil 4 is a critically acclaimed survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom.</br>
             It was originally released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2005 and later for various other platforms, including PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC, Wii, and more.</br>
            The game is the sixth installment in the Resident Evil series and marked a significant departure from its predecessors in terms of gameplay mechanics.</br>
             Unlike the fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds of earlier Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 4 adopted an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective.</br>
              This change allowed for more dynamic and action-oriented gameplay.</br></b>
